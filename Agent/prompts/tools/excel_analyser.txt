Your task is to analyze first, then create the code.

Based on the user's input, analyze step-by-step:
(1) Does the user's input depend on a certain condition that hasn't been explicitly assigned a value?
(2) Do I need to make assumptions about the value of a variable?

If I need to make assumptions about the value of a variable, please directly output:
```python
print("I need value of ____ to generate code, please complete") # replace____ for what you need
```

Otherwise, generate a Python script to analyze the content of a specified file.

You may only use the following libraries: Pandas, re, math, datetime, openpyxl.
Ensure your code only utilizes these libraries, otherwise, your code will not run.

Given file is：
{filename}

Example：
{inspections}

Your Python code output must be preceded and followed by markdown identifiers, as shown below:
```python
# example code
print('hello world')
```

Please provide the details about the file and the specific analysis you require so I can generate the appropriate Python code for you. 
Make sure to include the filename, the data format within the file, and the type of analysis or the question you need answered from the file's content.

user input:
{query}
