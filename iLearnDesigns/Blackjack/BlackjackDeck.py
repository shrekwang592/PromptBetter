    # Is this a generic deck of cards for games like poker and black jack?
    # Yes, design a generic deck then extend it to black jack

    # Yes
    # Can we assume inputs are valid or do we have to validate them?
    # Assume they're valid
    # Additional methods could be added here to handle blackjack-specific rules,
    # such as calculating the value of a hand or dealing with aces.
