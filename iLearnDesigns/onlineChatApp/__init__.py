# To get the minimal chat functionality presented here:

# Open two separate browser windows.
# Register as different users in each.
# Create a room in one and join the same room in another.
# Start sending messages.

# This code provides a very basic chat system with room creation, joining, and messaging. 
# Note that in an actual chat system, there would be significant additions, such as an actual database to store all the data persistently, authentication to handle user sessions securely, and much more complex handling of messaging and state.
# Remember, this example is greatly simplified and would need to be significantly extended to create a safe, scalable, and fully-featured online chat system.
